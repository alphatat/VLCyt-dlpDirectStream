# VLCyt-dlpDirectStream
A lua script to Stream youtube videos in VLC

## Why
So i have a very old laptop with 2gigs of ram and a very old dual core processor. And when I run a youtube video in the browser with higher resolution the laptop gets cooking hot and the video stucks and stutters..
But again i discovered that when i play a video in some local player like VLC or potplayer it just plays so smoothly like nothing is happening in that pc.
so here is the script that lets me Stream YT videos in vlc directly and also downloads Substitles or autogenerated captions..
the max resolution stream is at 1080p but can be changed easily by just modifying the max value in the code..
Code mostly written by AI.

## Installation
Things you need..
1. latest version of yt-dlp installed and path added with ffmpeg.
2. latest version of cURL added to path variable.
3. some wish to run the code..

To use the script..

 1. Download the lua file.[Youtube.lua](https://github.com/alphatat/VLCyt-dlpDirectStream/blob/main/youtube.lua)
 2. Copy and replace it to the path `C:\Program Files (x86)\VideoLAN\VLC\lua\playlist`
 3. Ctrl + N to open network streams panel and paste the link there and hit play. it should work..
